Description:
Jusst Audio Player is a mobile application developed as a challenge project for Jusst Engineering. This application interfaces with a WebSocket server to provide real-time updates on audio playback state and metadata. Users can visualize metadata such as cover art, artist, and title, control volume, playback, and seek through the track's duration. System state overlays inform users of any non-ready states. Built with Flutter, this project demonstrates integration with WebSocket communication, volume control, and UI visualization techniques for audio playback applications.
